Little program I've made to help me on my quest to visit every Metro station in Melbourne. This program will select a random station name from an imported .json file and 
give me the option to select it (which removes it from the selection next time) or roll for another one. I might add more features too, but I thought this would be a fun 
project now I've finished up with my tic tac toe program :3

Plan:
- Simple terminal interface (maybe using colours?)
- Import and modify a .json file for data storage
- Options to reroll if I don't like the choice
- Show what line the station is on and it's distance from the CBD/Southern Cross
- Counter for how many stations visited/how many remaining, in total and by line (maybe a small hooray msg if a line is completed)
- Maybe a "queue" that doesn't clear a station until I confirm I visited it?
- Maybe a GUI eventually!
- More?
