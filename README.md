# Rail Roulette ðŸš‰
### A simple TUI program to randomly pick stations on the Melbourne Metro network + other useful related things.

I have tasked myself with visiting every Melbourne train station served by Metro (I'm hoping to knock one off every couple of weeks or so) but how was I meant to choose which stations to visit? I don't have the braincells for that sort of decision-making, so instead I'm gonna make this program to do that for me and more! (oã‚œâ–½ã‚œ)oâ˜†

### The Plan:
- ~~Simple terminal interface (maybe using colours?)~~ - **done!**
- ~~Import and modify a .json file for data storage~~ - **done!**
- ~~Options to reroll if I don't like the choice~~ - **done!**
- ~~Show what line the station is on and it's distance from the CBD/Southern Cross~~ - **done!**
- Counter for how many stations visited/how many remaining, in total and by line (maybe a small hooray msg if a line is completed)
- ~~Maybe a "queue" that doesn't clear a station until I confirm I visited it?~~ - **done!**
- Maybe a GUI eventually!
- Option to manually mark a station as visited
- Log date a station was visited (can take user input for this)
- Look up info on stations (PT connections, nearby stations + other stuff already included in datastore)
- More?

Please keep in the mind I will most likely forget to keep the above up-to-date. Check the code yourself if it's been a few commits since I messed with this README. If anyone except me is even reading this. I wanna be thrown into a wall by chimera Falin ouuuhghbbghghhh
